# Aurian Numbers

**A Novel Digit-Based Numerical Identity**

### üìñ Overview

**Aurian Numbers** are a unique class of positive integers defined by a special relationship between the subtraction of their digits (from right to left) and the difference between the sum and the product of their digits.

### üî¢ Definition

Let `N` be a k‚Äëdigit number with digits `d‚ÇÅ d‚ÇÇ ‚Ä¶ d‚Çñ` (`d‚ÇÅ` = leftmost, `d‚Çñ` = rightmost).

1. **Subtractive Reduction**  
S = d‚Çñ ‚Äì d‚Çñ‚Çã‚ÇÅ ‚Äì ‚Ä¶ ‚Äì d‚ÇÅ

3. **Digit Sum & Product**
4. Sum = d‚ÇÅ + d‚ÇÇ + ‚Ä¶ + d‚Çñ
Product = d‚ÇÅ √ó d‚ÇÇ √ó ‚Ä¶ √ó d‚Çñ

3. **Aurian Condition**
   S == (Sum - Product)
Example:
Enter a number: 1124
1124 is an Aurian Number
